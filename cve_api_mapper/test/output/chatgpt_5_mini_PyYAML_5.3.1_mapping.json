  "CVE-2020-14343": {
    "apis": [
      "yaml.load",
      "yaml.load_all",
      "yaml.unsafe_load",
      "yaml.unsafe_load_all",
      "yaml.Loader",
      "yaml.UnsafeLoader"
    ],
    "reason": "The CVE states a \"flaw in the yaml.load() function\", which directly names yaml.load. The description that an attacker can craft a \"specially-crafted YAML file\" that \"could execute arbitrary code\" indicates unsafe deserialization behavior; that behavior is exposed by yaml.load and its multi-document variant yaml.load_all, by the explicit unsafe entry points yaml.unsafe_load and yaml.unsafe_load_all, and by the underlying loader classes (yaml.Loader and yaml.UnsafeLoader) that implement the unsafe object construction used during loading."
