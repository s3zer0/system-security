  "CVE-2020-14343": {
    "apis": [
      "yaml.load",
      "yaml.FullLoader",
      "yaml.loader.FullLoader",
      "yaml.full_load"
    ],
    "reason": "The phrase 'flaw in the yaml.load() function' directly identifies yaml.load as the vulnerable entry point. In PyYAML 5.3.1, yaml.load operates through loader classes such as yaml.FullLoader (also exposed as yaml.loader.FullLoader), and yaml.full_load is the convenience wrapper that invokes yaml.load with FullLoader; this processing path enabled a crafted YAML file to 'execute arbitrary code on the system'."
